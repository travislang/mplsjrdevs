# Adding yourself to the website

Are you a member of the Mpls Jr Devs community, and want to be featured on our website? You can add your name, picture, social links, and a short bio to our [Community page](https://mplsjrdevs.com/community)!

Here's how:

1. Follow the <a href='#development-instructions'>**Development Instructions**</a> above
2. Add your profile picture to `src/images/community/firstname-lastname.jpg`. It should be square, a JPEG, and approximately 500px in both dimensions.
3. Create a component file for yourself and save it to `src/components/community/firstname-lastname.js`
4. In your component file, export a [JSON object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON). Update the fields with your information, and remove any you don't want to display:

```js
export default {
    id: 'firstname-lastname',
    name: 'Firstname Lastname',
    twitter: 'https://twitter.com/username',
    website: 'http://example.com',
    github: 'https://github.com/username',
    bio: () => "The bio key can be a function that returns a string, a React component, or nothing at all -- you choose!"
}
```
5. Create a new branch, commit your work to it, and submit a pull request from your forked repo to this repo. Someone on the website team will review, leave feedback, and merge your PR when it's ready.
